## 📚 Recipe Notebooks

We provide **hands-on, annotated notebooks** that walk through the theory and simulation techniques for each process.

| Process                    | Continuous Time | Discrete Time | Notebooks                              |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Brownian Motion            | ✅               | ✅             | [View](notebooks/BrownianMotion.ipynb) |
| Brownian Bridge            | ✅               | ✅             | [View](notebooks/BrownianBridge.ipynb) |
| Fractional Brownian Motion | ❌               | ✅             | [View](notebooks/FractionalBM.ipynb)   |

> Recipes use NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for simulation and visualization. Each recipe is self-contained and suitable for learning, experimentation, and benchmarking.

## 🧠 Why "Cookbook"?

This project is inspired by the philosophy of **learning by example**. Like a culinary cookbook, we offer **ready-to-serve "recipes"**—not just raw ingredients (code)—so you can dive in, explore, and build your own models with ease.
